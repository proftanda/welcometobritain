{"name":"Welcome To Britain","tagline":"Al project for Popathon at Brighton Digital Festival 2014","body":"### About.\r\nDeveloped over a 24 hour workshop, Welcome To Britain aimed to draw on the visual language and mechanics of Minecraft to find a format for making the news engaging for younger children.\r\n\r\nThe project focused on the topic of migration and places the user as a protagonist in an attempted journey to Britain, along the way, linking to related news stories about events in similar journeys that have actually taken place.\r\n\r\nA prototype using Minecraft or a Minecraft-like web-platform such as voxel.js proved too complex for the time so this prototype was developed using Twine as a simple way to map out the story and to deliver the interaction, with the intention of overlaying this interaction on Minecraft videos or images.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
